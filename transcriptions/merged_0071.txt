Mrs. Griffin, however, expressed the need for a little more light. Who was it she was in love with? The story will tell. I took upon myself to reply. Oh, I can't wait for the story. The story won't tell. Said Douglas. Not in any literal vulgar way. More's the pity then. Won't you tell Douglas? Well, if I don't know who she was in love with. I know who he was. Let me say here distinctly to have done with it that this narrative, from an exact transcript of my own, made much later, is what I shall presently give. Poor Douglas, before his death, when it wasn't sight, committed to me the manuscript that reached him on the third of these days and that, on the same spot, with immense effect, began to read to our hushed little circle on the night of the fourth. The departing ladies, who had said they would stay, didn't, of course, thank heaven, stay, they departed in consequence of arrangements made. In a rage of curiosity as they professed, produced by the touches with which he had already worked us up.

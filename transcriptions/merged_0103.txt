Some points may be taken as fixed and such as any theory of memory must arrive at. In this case, as in most others, what may be taken as certain in advance is rather vague. The first of our vague but indulitable data is that there is knowledge of the past. We might provisionally, though perhaps not quite correctly, define memory as that way of knowing about the past, which has no analog and our knowledge of the future. Such a definition would at least serve to mark the problem with which we are concerned. Those some expectations may deserve to rank with memory as regards in media see. This distinction is vital to the understanding of memory, but it is not so easy to carry out in practice as it is to draw in theory. A gramophone, by the help of suitable records, might relate to us the incidents of its past, and people are not so different from gramophone's as they like to believe. I can set to work now to remember things I never remembered before, such as what I had to eat for breakfast this morning, and it can hardly be wholly habit that enables me to do this. The fact that a man can recite a poem, does not show that he remembers any previous occasion on which he has recited or read it. Simmons, two books, mentioned in an earlier lecture, do not touch knowledge memory at all closely. They give laws according to which images of past occurrences come into our minds, but do not discuss our belief that these images refer to past occurrences, which is what constitutes knowledge memory.

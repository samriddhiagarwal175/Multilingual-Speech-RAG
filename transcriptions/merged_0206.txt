200 warriors feasted in his hall and followed him to battle. The rest of you off of hiking, he had three ships. These he gave to three of my brothers. But I stayed that spring and built me a boat. I made her for only 20 years because I thought, few men would follow me. Probably was young, 15 years old. At the prow I carved the head with open mouth and forked tongue thrust out. I painted the eyes red for anger. They are stance so I said, and glare and hissed my foes. In the stern I carved the tail up almost as high as the head. There she sat on the rollers as fair as ship as I ever saw.

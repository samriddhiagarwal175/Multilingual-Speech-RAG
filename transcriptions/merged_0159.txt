Alice took up the fan and gloves, and as the hall was very hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking. Dear, dear, how queer everything is today and yesterday things went on just as usual. I wonder if I've been changed in the night. I almost think I can remember feeling a little different. I'll try if I know all the things I used to know. I shall never get to 20 at that rate.

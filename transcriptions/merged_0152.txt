A sudden impulse came over him to enter and see if they were indeed the proofs. He put his shoes on the table. Gloves said the young man. Suddenly he heard him at the very door there was no possible escape. Have I told the truth, Mr. Guildkrist? I have a letter here, Mr. Somes, which I wrote to you early this morning in the middle of a restless night. It would be clear to you from what I have said that only you could have let this young man out since you were left in the room and must have locked the door when you went out. It was simple enough, sir. If you only had known, but with all your cleverness, it was impossible that you could know if Mr. Somme saw them, the game was up. Saturday, August 15th. The sea and broken all round. No land in sight.

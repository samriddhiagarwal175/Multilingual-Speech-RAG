Wall seemed to him well enough as his science, but he never could discover a practical case where it appeared to him worthwhile to go to law. And all the clients who stopped with this new clerk in the anti-room of the law office where he was writing, Philip invariably advised to settle. No matter how, but settle. Greatly, to the disgust of his employer, who knew that justice between man and man could only be attained by the recognized processes with the attendant fees. It is such a noble ambition that it is a pity it has usually such a shallow foundation. He wanted to begin at the top of the ladder. Fill up there for red diligently in the Aster library, planned literary works that should compel attention and nurse his genius. He had no friend to wise enough to tell him to step into the dorking convention, then in session, make a sketch of the men and women on the platform, and take it to the editor of the Daily Grapevine and see what he could get a line for it. Oh, very well, said Gringo, turning away with a shade of contempt. You'll find, if you are going into literature and newspaper work, that you can't afford a conscience like that. But Philup did afford it, and he wrote, thinking his friends and declining because he said the political scheme would fail and ought to fail.

You can begin by carrying a rod and putting down the figures.

They were now illuminated by the morning radiance of a young child's disposition, but later in the day of earthly existence might be prolific of the storm and whirlwind. Hester Prin, nevertheless, the loving mother of this one child, ran little risk of airing on the side of undue severity. Mindful, however, of her own errors and misfortunes. She early sought to impose a tender but strict control over the infant immortality that was committed to her charge. As to any other kind of discipline, whether addressed to her mind or heart, little pearl might or might not be within its reach in accordance with the caprice that rolled the moment. It was a look so intelligent, yet inexplicable, perverse, sometimes so malicious, but generally accompanied by a wild flow of spirits that Hester could not help questioning at such moments, whether Pearl was a human child. Beholding it, Hester was constrained to rush towards the child, to pursue the little elf in the flight which she invariably began, to snatch her to her bosom with a close pressure and earnest kisses, not so much from overflowing love as to assure herself that Pearl was flesh and blood and not utterly delusive. Brewing overall these matters, the mother felt like one who has evoked a spirit, but by some irregularity in the process of conjuration has failed to win the master word that should control this new and incomprehensible intelligence. Pearl was a borne outcast of the infantile world. We're all saw and gazed intently but never sought to make acquaintance. If spoken to, she would not speak again.

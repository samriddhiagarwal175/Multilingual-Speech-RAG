Shall I never miss home talk and blessing and the common kiss that comes to each and turn? Nor counted strange when I look up to drop on a new range of walls and floors another home than this. I have grieved so I am hard to love. Open my heart wide and fold within the wet wings of thy dove. it mean to last. I love set pendulous between sorrow and sorrow. Nay, I rather thrilled, distrusting every light that seemed to gill the onward path, and fear to overlead a finger even. And though I have grown serene and strong since then, I think that God has willed a still renewable fear. Oh love. Oh trough. And love be false. If he to keep one oath must lose one joy by his life's star for to hold. Slow to world greetings. Quick with it's oh list when the angel speak.

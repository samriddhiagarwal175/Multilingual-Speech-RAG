I'm stiff with long sitting, he said, I edge for a fight. I turned to the farmer. This is our last feast with you, I said. By the beard of Odin, I cried, you have taken our joke like a man. My men pounded the table with their fists. By the hammer of Thor shouted grim, there is no stingy coward. Here, friend, take it. And he thrust into the farmer's hand. May you drink heartsees from it for many years. And with it, I leave you a name, sift the friendly. I shall hope to drink with you some time and fall hollow.

The farmer sat gloomily on the bench and would not eat. And you cannot wonder, for he saw us putting potfuls of his good beef and basculodes of bread and d'ar big mouths. You would not eat with us. You cannot say no to half of my ale. I drink this to your health, then I drink half of the hornful and set the rest across the fire to the farmer. He took it and smiled saying, Did you ever have such a lordly guest before? I went on. So I will give out this law that my I mention I'll never leave you alone. Hawking there shall be your constant companion, friend farmer. He shall not leave you day or night, whether you were working or playing or sleeping. I named nine others and said, and these shall follow your thralls in the same way. So I set guards over, everyone in that house.

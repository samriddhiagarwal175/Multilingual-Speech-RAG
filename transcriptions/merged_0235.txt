Some of the penal regulations were copied from the edicts of Diocletian, and this method of conversion was applauded by the same bishops who had felt the hand of oppression and pleaded for the rights of humanity. They asserted with confidence and almost with exultation that the apostolic succession was interrupted that all the bishops of Europe and Asia were infected by the contagion of guilt and schism, and that the parogatives of the Catholic Church were confined to the chosen portion of the African believers, who alone had preserved invalid the integrity of their faith and discipline.

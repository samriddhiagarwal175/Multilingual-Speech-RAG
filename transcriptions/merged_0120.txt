Thinking of all this, I went to sleep. Mr. Neverbend began the captain, and I observed that up to that moment he had generally addressed me as president. It cannot be denied that we have come here on an unpleasant mission. You have received us with all that courtesy and hospitality for which your character in England stands so high. It is a duty, said I. your power is so superior to any that I can advance as to make us here feel that there is no disgrace in yielding to it. Not a doubt, but had your force been only double or trouble our own, I should have found out my duty to struggle with you. That is all quite true, Mr. Never been, said Sir Ferdinand O'Bran. I can afford to smile because I am absolutely powerless before you. But I do not the less feel that in a matter of which the progress of the world as concerned I, or rather we, have been put down by brute force. You have come to us threatening us with absolute destruction. Therefore I feel myself quite able as President of this Republic to receive you with a courtesy due to the servants of a friendly ally.

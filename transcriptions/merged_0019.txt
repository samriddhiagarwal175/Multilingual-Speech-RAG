Edison had installed his historic first great Central Station system in New York on the multiple arc system covered by his feeder and main invention, which resulted in a notable saving in the cost of conductors as against a straight-to-wire system throughout of the tree kind. He soon foresaw that still greater economy would be necessary for commercial success, not alone for the larger territory opening, but for the compact district of large cities. The strong position held by the Edison system under the Strenuous Competition that was already springing up was enormously improved by the introduction of the three-wire system, and it gave an immediate impetus to incandescent lighting. It was specially suited for a trial-plat-all-so. In the early days, when a yield of six or eight lamps to the horse power was considered subject for congratulation. The street conductors were of the overhead whole line construction. And were installed by the construction company that had been organized by Edison to build and equip central stations. Meanwhile, he had called upon me to make a report of the three-wire system known in England as the Hopkinson, both Dr. John Hopkinson and Mr. Edison being independent inventors at practically the same time. I think he was perhaps more appreciative that I was of the discipline of the Edison Construction Department. And thought it would be well for us to wait until the morning of the fourth before we started up. But the plant ran, and it was the first three-wire station in this country. They were later used as reserve machines and, finally, with the engine retired from service as part of the collection of Edisonia. But they remain, in practically, as good condition, as one installed in 1883. The Arclamp installed outside a customer's premises, or in a circuit for public street lighting, burned so many hours nightly, so many nights in the month, and was paid for at that rate. Subject to rebate for hours when the lamp might be out through accident.

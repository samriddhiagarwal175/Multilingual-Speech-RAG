The first of these touches conveyed that the written statement took up the tale, at a point after it had, in a manner, begun. He had for his own town residents a big house filled with the spoils of travel and the trophies of the chase, but it was to his country home. An old family placed in Essex, that he wished her immediately to proceed. The awkward thing was that they had practically no other relations, and that his own affairs took up all his time. They were plenty of people to help, but of course the young lady who should go down as governess would be in supreme authority. I don't anticipate. She was young, untried, nervous. It was a vision of serious duties and little company. Of really great loneliness. Yes, but that's just the beauty of her passion. It was the beauty of it. It sounded dull, that sounded strange. And all the more so because of his main condition, which was, she promised to do this, and she mentioned to me that when for a moment, disperdined, delighted, he held her hand, thanking her for the sacrifice. She already felt rewarded.

A ring of amethyst, I could not wear here, plainer to my sight, then that first kiss. That was the chrysalm of love, which loves own crown, with sanctifying sweetness did proceed the third upon my lips, was folded down in perfect, purple, state. Once when, indeed, I have been proud and said, my love, my own. Dearest, teach me so to pour out gratitude as thou dust good. Musselmans and gaiwers throw curchets at a smile and have no roof for any weeping, but thou art not such a lover, my beloved. How canst wait through sorrow and sickness to bring souls to touch and think it soon when others cry too late? I thank all who have loved me in their hearts with thanks and love from mine. Oh, to shoot my souls full meaning into future years that they should lend it utterance and salute love that endures from life that disappears. When I long tried by natural oils received the comfort fast, while budding, at the eyesight my pilgrim's staff gave out green leaves with morning dues, imperiled. I love thee freely as men strive for right. I love thee purely as they turn from praise.

He would be like a phylogist refusing to examine a fact in language, if a philosopher hesitating to scrutinize a fact in humanity. What is slang properly speaking? It is the language of righteousness. We may be stopped. The fact may be put to us in general terms, which is one way of attenuating it. We may be told that all trades, professions, it may be added, all the accidents of the social hierarchy and all forms of intelligence have their own slang. The painter who says, my grinder, the notary who says, my skip the gutter, the hairdresser who says, my mealy back, the cobbler who says, my cub talks slang. There is the slang of the affected lady as well as of the press uses. The sugar manufacturer who says, loaf clarified lumps, bastard, common, burnt. This honest manufacturer talks slang. Algebra, medicine, botany, have each their slang. To meet the needs of this conflict, retidness has invented a language of combat, which is slang. To keep afloat and to rescue from oblivion, to hold above the gulf, where it but a fragment of some language, which man has spoken and which would otherwise be lost. That is to say, one of the elements, good or bad, of which civilization is composed, or by which it is complicated to extend the records of social observation is to serve civilization itself.

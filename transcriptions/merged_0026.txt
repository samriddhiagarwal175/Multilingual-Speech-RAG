Captain Martin said, I shall give you a pistol to help protect yourself if worse comes to worst. In the early morning of the next day, May 29, a company of dragons with one empty saddle came down from the fort. And while the pro-slavery men still slept, the prisoner and his escort were on their way across the prairies to the Compton, in the charge of officers of the United States Army. It is a very final place of Red Brick, softened by a pale, powdery lichen, which has dispersed itself with happy irregularity. So as to bring the Red Brick into terms of friendly companionship with a limestone ornaments surrounding the three gables, the windows and the door place. But the windows are patched with wooden pains, and the door, I think, is like the gate. It is never opened. For it is a solid, heavy, handsome door, and must once have been in the habit of shutting with a sonorous bang behind the Livry Lackie, who had just seen his master and mistress off the grounds in a carriage and pair. A large, open fireplace with rusty dogs in it, and a bearer-borted floor. At the far end, fleeces of wool stacked up. in the middle of the floor, some empty corn bags, and what through the left-hand window? Several closed horses, a pylion, a spinning wheel, and an old box wide open and stuffed full of colored rags. At the edge of this box, their lies a great wooden doll, which, so far as mutilation is concerned, bears a strong resemblance to the finest Greek sculpture, and especially in the total loss of its nose. The history of the house is plain now.

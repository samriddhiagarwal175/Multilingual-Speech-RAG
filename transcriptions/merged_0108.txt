Kezwick, March 22nd, 1837. Dear Madame, your letter has given me great pleasure, and I should not forgive myself if I did not tell you so. Of this second letter also she spoke and told me that it contained an invitation for her to go and see the poet if ever she visited the lakes. On August 27th, 1837 she writes, Come come, I'm getting really tired of your absence. Saturday after Saturday comes around and I can have no hope of hearing your knock at the door and then being told that Missy is come, oh dear, in this monotonous life of mine that was a pleasant event. I wish it were recurrent again but it will take two or three interviews before the stiffness, the enshrangement of this long separation will wear away. My eyes fill tears when I contrast the bliss of such a state, brightened by hopes of the future, with the melancholy state I now live in uncertain that I ever felt true, contrition. Wondering, in thought, and deed, longing for holiness, which I shall never, never obtain, smitten at times to the heart, with the conviction that ghastly, calvinistic doctrines are true, darkened in short by the very shadows of spiritual death. If Christian perfection be necessary to salvation, I shall never be saved. My heart is a very hot bed for sinful thoughts, and when I decide on an action I scarce Remember to look to my Redeemer for a direction.

Something better, something still grander must follow, but what? Rejoice in our presence. So the air in the sunlight. Rejoice in my own fresh youth. But the tree did not rejoice at all. He grew and grew and was green both winter and summer. And towards Christmas he was one of the first that was cut down. The axe struck deep into the very pith. The tree fell to the earth with a sigh. He felt a pang. It was like a swoon. He could not think of happiness. For he was sorrowful at being separated from his home from the place where he had sprung up. He well knew that he should never see his dear old comrades the little bushes and flowers around him any more, perhaps not even the birds. The departure was not at all agreeable. The tree only came to himself when he was unloaded in a courtyard with the other trees and heard a man say, that one is splendid. We don't want the others. There too were large easy chairs, silken sofas, large tables, full of picture books and full of toys worth hundreds and hundreds of crowns, at least the children said so.

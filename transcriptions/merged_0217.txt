Yes, why not thought Anders? Seeing that I am so fine, I may as well go and visit the king. I am going to the court ball, answered Anders, and she took Anders hand and walked with him up the broad marble stairs, where soldiers were posted at every third step, and through the magnificent halls, where courteers, in silk and velvet stood bowing wherever he went, or like as not, they must have thought him a prince when they saw his fine cap. At the farther end of the largest hall, a table was set with golden cups and golden plates in long rows. On huge silver platters were pyramids of tarts and cakes and red wine sparkled in glittering decanters. The prince set down under a blue canopy with bouquets of roses and she let Anders sit in a golden chair by her side. But you must not eat with your cap on your head, she said, and was going to dig it off. The princess certainly was beautiful, and he would have dearly liked to be kissed by her, but the cap, which his mother had made, he would not give up on any condition.

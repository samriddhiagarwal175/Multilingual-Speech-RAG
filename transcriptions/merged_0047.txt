But in this vignette copied from Turner, you have the two principles brought out perfectly. They are beyond all other works that I know existing, dependent for their effect on low, subdued tones, their favorite choice in time of day being either dawn or twilight, and even their brightest sunsets produced chiefly out of grey paper. It may be that a great colorless will use his utmost force of color as a singer his full power voice, but loud or low, the virtue is in both cases always in refinement, never in loudness. It must remember be one or the other. Do not therefore think that the Gothic schools in easy one. The law of that school is that everything shall be seen clearly, or at least, only in such misd or faintness as shall be delightful. And I have no doubt that the best introduction to it would be the elementary practice of painting every study on a golden ground. This at once compels you to understand that the work is to be imaginative and decorative that it represents beautiful things in the clearest way, but not under existing conditions. And that, in fact, you are producing jewelers work rather than pictures. That a style is restrained or severe does not mean that it is also erroneous. In all earthly Gothic art indeed you will find failure of this kind, especially distortion and rigidity, which are in many respects painfully to be compared with the splendid repose of classic art. The large letter contains indeed entirely feeble and ill-drawn figures. That is merely childish and failing work of an inferior hand. It is not characteristic of Gothic or any other school.

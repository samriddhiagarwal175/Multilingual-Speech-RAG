During his watch, I slept. Two hours afterwards, a terrible shock, a woke me. The raft was heaved up on a watery mountain and pitched down again at a distance of 20 phathoms. There's a whale, a whale, cried the professor. Flight was out of the question now. The reptiles rose. They wheeled around our little raft with a rapidity greater than that of express trains. Two monsters only were creating all this commotion, and before my eyes are two reptiles of the primitive world. I can distinguish the eye of the IckthiaSaurus, glowing like a red hot coal and as large as a man's head. Its jaw is enormous and according to naturalists, it is armed with no less than 182 teeth. Those huge creatures attack each other with a greatest animosity. Suddenly, the IckthiaSaurus and the Plesyosaurus disappear below, leaving a warpull etching in the water.

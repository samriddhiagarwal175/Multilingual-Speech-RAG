And fear is down because I vanish and am seen no more. It is to tenfold life to love, to peace, and raptures wholly. Unseen descending, way my light wings upon Bommie flowers, and court the fair I do to take me to her shining tent, the weeping virgin trembling kneels before the risen sun. till we arise linked in a golden band, and never part, but walk, united bearing food to all our tender flowers, lives not alone, nor of itself. Fear not, and I will call. The weak worm from its lowly bed, and thou shalt hear its voice. Come forth worm and the silent valley to the expensive queen. The helpless worm arose and sat upon the lilies leaf, and the bright cloud sailed on, defined his partner in the veil. Image of weakness, art thou but a worm? I see they lay helpless and naked, weeping and none to answer, none to cherish thee with mother's smiles. And says, thou mother of my children, I have loved thee, and I have given thee a crown that none can take away, and lay me down and I coldbed and leave my shining lot.

You will find me continually speaking of form and, Titian, Holbein, Turner, and Tintaret, in almost the same terms. They unite every quality, and sometimes you will find me referring to them as colorists, sometimes as Kira's skurists. By being studious of color they are studious of division, and while the Kira's skurists devotes himself to the representation of degrees of force and one thing, unseparated light. The colorists have for their function, the attainment of beauty, by arrangement of the divisions of light. My first and principal reason was that they enforced beyond all resistance. On any student who might attempt to copy them, this method of laying portions of distinct hue side by side. Some of the touches, indeed, when the tint has been mixed with much water, have been laid in little drops or ponds so that the pigment might crystallize hard at the edge. Just the head of a parrot with a little flower in his beak from a picture of Carpazzius. One of his series of the life of St. George, then he comes to the beak of it. The brown ground beneath his left for the most part. One touch of black is put for the hollow, two delicate lines of dark gray to find the outer curve, and one little quivering touch of white draws the inner edge of the mandible. For believe me, the final philosophy of art can only ratify their opinion that the beauty of a cockroach in this to be read, and of a grass plot to be green. And the best skill of art is an instantly seizing on the manifold deliciousness of light, which you can only seize by precision of instantaneous touch. Now you will see in these studies that the moment the white isn't closed properly and harmonize with the other use, it becomes somehow more precious and pearly than the white paper. And then I am not afraid to leave a whole field of untreated white paper all round it, being sure that even the little diamonds in the round window will tell us jewels if they're gradated justly.

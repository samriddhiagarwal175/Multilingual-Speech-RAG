The great Huck followed hurdly to retrieve his prey from the ground. The cat growned softly, picked up the prize in her jaws and trotted into the bushes to devour it. In fact, he had just finished it. The last of the trout's tail had just vanished with a spasm down his strained gullet, when the bavod Huck caught sight of him and swooped. The Huck elided on the dead branch and sat upright, motionless as if surprised, Like his unfortunate little cousin, the teal, he too had felt the fear of death smitten into his heart, and was heading desperately for the refuge of some dark, over-hanging bank, deep fringe with weeds, where the dreadful eye of the hawk should not discern him. The hawk sat upon the branch and watched his quarry swimming beneath the surface, almost instantly he was forced to the top, straight away the hawk glided from his perch and darted after him. But at this point in the rapids it was impossible for him to stay down, but this frequenter of the heights of air for all his savage valor was troubled at the leaping waves in the tossing foam of these mad rapids. He did not understand them.

I felt it in my bones when I woke this morning that something splendid was going to turn up. I thought it might be sister-kater cousin Mike would be happening along. She pushed him toward the big chair by the fire and sat down on a stool at the opposite side of the hearth, her knees drawn up to her chin, laughing like a happy little girl. When did you come Bartly and how did it happen? You haven't spoken a word. I got in about 10 minutes ago. Alexander leaned forward and warmed his hands before the blaze. Bartly bent lowered over the fire. She looked at his heavy shoulders and big determined head thrust forward like a catapult in leash. I'll do anything you wish me to, Bartley. She said tremulously. I can't stand seeing you miserable.

And the one Oracle, having spoken, she sat down in the same sort of abstraction again beside Dorcus, and she looked full in her cousin's eyes. Of Mark Wilder, I say this. His name has been for years hateful to me, and recently it has become frightful, and you will promise me simply this, that you will never ask me to speak again about him. It is an antipathy, and antipathy I cannot get over dear Dorcus. You may think it amadness, but don't blame me. I have very few to love me now, and I thought you might love me as I have begun to love you, and she threw her arms round her cousin's neck and brave Rachel at last burst into tears. Dorcus, in her strange way, was moved. I like you still Rachel. I'm sure I'll always like you. You resemble me, Rachel. You are fearless and inflexible and generous. Yes Rachel, I do love you. Thank you, Dorchester.

It must be as wide as the Mediterranean, or the Atlantic, and why not? These thoughts agitated me all day, and my imagination scarcely calmed down after several hours sleep. I shudder as I recall these monsters to my remembrance. I saw at the Hamburg Museum, the skeleton of one of these creatures, 30 feet in length. I suppose Professor Leidenbrock was of my opinion too, and even shared my fears. For after having examined the pig, his eyes traversed the ocean from side to side. Tuesday, August 18th.

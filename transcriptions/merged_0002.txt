Thus did the humane and right-minded father comfort his unhappy daughter, and her mother embracing her again did all she could to sue the feelings. She, meanwhile, passed her life with her parents in the strictest retirement, never letting herself be seen, but shunning every eye a list it should read her misfortune in her face. Time rolled on, the hour of her delivery arrived, it took place in the utmost secrecy. Her mother taking upon her the office of Midwife, as she gave birth to a son, what are the most beautiful ever seen? On the boy walked through the streets, blessings were shoured upon him by all who saw him, blessing upon his beauty, upon the mother that bore him, upon the father that begot him, upon those who brought him up so well. One day when the boy was sent by his grandfather with a message to a relation, he passed As a long street, in which there was a great concourse of horsemen, the bed she too well remembered was there, and above all the cabinet, on which had stood the image yet taken away, was still on the same spot. Lewis was out of danger in a fortnight, and a month he rose from his bed, and during all that time he was visited daily by his mother and grandmother, and treated by the master and mistress of the house as if he was their own child. Thus saying and pressing the crucifix to her breast, she fell fainting into the arms of Donna Estafania, who has a gentle woman, to whose sex pity is a natural as cruelty as to a man. Instantly pressed her lips to those of the fainting girl, shedding over her so many tears that there needed no other sprinkling of water to recover Leo Kedia from her soul. I have great things to tell you, Senyor, Sadhana Estafania to her husband. The cream and substance of which is this, the fainting girl before you is your daughter. And the boy is your grandson. This truth which I have learned from her lips is confirmed by his face in which we have both be held that of our son.

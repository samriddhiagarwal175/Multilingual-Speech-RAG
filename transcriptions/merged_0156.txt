As for the Ithiasaurus, has he returned to his submarine cabin? The rohings become lost in the distance. The weather. If we may use the term, we'll change before long. The atmosphere is charged with vapors, provided with the electricity generated by the evaporation of saline waters. The electric light can scarcely penetrate through the dense curtain, which is dropped over the theater on which the battle of the elements is about to be waged. The air is heavy. The sea is calm. From time to time a fleecy tough to miss, with yet some gleaming light left upon it, drops down upon the dense floor of grey and loses itself in the opaque and impenetrable mass. The atmosphere is evidently charged and surcharged with electricity. The wind never lools, but to acquire increased strength. The vast bank of heavy clouds is a huge reservoir of fearful, windy gusts and rushing storms. There's a heavy storm coming on, I cried, pointing towards the horizon.

The description she gave of the coming reception to the women's political league was so humorous and diverting that they were both laughing heartily over the thing when the young people passed them. And thus, Mr. Hopkins failed to notice who the occupants of the other vehicle were. These women were flattered by the attention of the young lady and had promised to assist in electing Mr. Forbes. Louise hoped for excellent results from this organization and wished the entertainment to be so effective in winning their good will that they would work earnestly for the cause in which they were enlisted. The Fairview Band was engaged to discourse as much harmony as it could produce, and the resources of the Great House were taxed to entertain the guests. Tables were spread on the lawn and a dainty but substantial repost was to be served. This was the first occasion within a generation when such an entertainment had been given at Elmhurst and the only one within the memory of man were the neighbors and country people had been the invited guests. The attendance was unexpectedly large and the girls were delighted for seeing great success for their fight. They ought to have more attendance, Beth, said Louise approaching her cousin. Won't you run into the house and see if Martha can't spare one or two more mates?

To bestow peace and grace lies in the province of God who alone can create these blessings. The angels cannot. Otherwise Paul should have written, grace from God the Father and peace from our Lord Jesus Christ. The Aryans took Christ for a noble and perfect creature superior even to the angels, because by him God created heaven and earth. Muhammad also speaks highly of Christ. Paul sticks to his theme. He never loses sight of the purpose of his epistle. gold or silver or partial lambs or an angel but himself. What for? Not for a crown or a kingdom or a goodness but for our sins. Underscore these words for their full of comfort for sore or consciences. How may we obtain remission of our sins?

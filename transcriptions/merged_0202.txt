We've tortured each other enough for tonight. Hilder was very nice to him, and he sat on the edge of his chair, flushed with his conversational efforts, and moving his chin about nervously over his high collar. They asked him to come to see them in Chelsea, and they spoke very tenderly of Hilder. Lamb wouldn't care a great deal about many of them, I fancy. When Bartley arrived at Bedford Square on Sunday evening, Marie, the pretty little French girl, met him at the door and conducted him upstairs. I should never have asked you if Molly had been here, for I remember you don't like English cookery. I haven't had a chance to tell you what a jolly little place I think this is. They are all sketches made about the villideste you see. Those fellows are all very loyal, even main hall. I've managed to save something every year, and that with helping my three sisters now and then, and tiding poor cousin Michael for bad seasons.

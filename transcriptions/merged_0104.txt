It is this that is a ventrist to theory of knowledge. It is by no means always reliable. Almost everybody has at some time experienced the well-known illusion that all that is happening now happened before at some time. Whenever the sense of familiarity occurs without a definite object, it leads us to search the environment until we are satisfied that we have found the appropriate object, which leads us to the judgment. This is familiar. Thus no knowledge as to the past is to be derived from the feeling of familiarity alone. A further stage is recognition. Recognition in this sense does not necessarily involve more than a habit of association. The kind of object we are seeing at the moment is associated with the word cat or with an auditory image of purring or Whatever other characteristic we may happen to recognize in the cat of the moment. We are, of course, in fact, able to judge when we recognize an object that we have seen it before. But this judgment is something over and above recognition in this first sense, and may very probably be impossible to animals that nevertheless have the experience of recognition in this first sense of the word. This knowledge is memory in one sense, though in another it is not. There are, however, several points in which such an account of recognition is inadequate. To begin with, it might seem at first sight more correct to define recognition as, I have seen this before, than as this has existed before. The definition of my experience is difficult. broadly speaking, it is everything that is connected with what I am experiencing now by certain links of which the various forms of memory are among the most important.

Lourjan, taking out gold cigarette case from his left hand upper waist coast pocket, all about him was a tumult of bright and broken collar, scattered and broad splashes. The McGantzer had a crested head of eardessent green black, a broad collar of lustrous white, black, black and white wings, white belly, sides finely penciled and black and white, and a rest of rich chestnut red streaked with black. His feet were red, his long, narrow beak, with its salt-toothed edges and sharp hooked tip was bright red. But here he was at a terrible disadvantage as compared with the owls, hawks and eagles. He had no rending claws. But suddenly, straight and swift as a dive in the quimberant, he shot down into the torrent and disappeared beneath the surface. Once fairly awake, however, he wheeled and made back hurly for his perch. You might have seen that a trout of this size was a fairly substantial meal, but such was his keenness that even while the wide flukes of his engorge-divicdom were still sticking out of the corners of his beak, his fierce red eyes were once more peering downward into the torrent and such a fresh prey. In despair, he hurled himself downward too soon.

who began the quarrel, was it the Mormons? As a sample of the press comments against the brutality of the Missyrians I quote a paragraph from the Quincy Argus, March 16th 1839. It will be observed that an organized mob, aided by many of the civil and military officers of Missyrian, with governor Bogs at their head, have been the prominent actors in this business. Inside it too it appears against the Mormons by political hatred and by the additional motives of plunder and revenge. The army found the people in poverty and left them in comparative wealth, but a word further concerning the expedition in general. It was through Floyd's advice to the Buchanan order the military expedition to Utah, ostensibly, to install certain federal officials and to repress and alleged infantile rebellion, which in fact had never come into existence, but in reality to further the interests of the secessionists. Moreover, had the people been inclined to rebellion, what greater opportunity could they have wished, already in north and south were talked of, why not set up also a west? They knew no north, no south, no east, no west. They stood positively by the constitution, and would have nothing to do in the bloody strife between brothers, unless indeed they were summoned by the authority to which they had already once loyally responded, to furnish men and arms for the country's need. What the latter day Saints call celestial marriage is characteristic of the church and is in very general practice. But of celestial marriage, plurality of wives was an incident never and essential.

Paul answers, the man who has named Jesus Christ and the Son of God gave Himself for our sins. Since Christ was given for our sins, it stands to reason that they cannot be put away by our own efforts. This sentence also defines our sins as great, so great in fact that the whole world could not make a men's for a single sin. The greatness of the ransom Christ the Son of God indicates this. The vicious character of sin is brought out by the words who gave himself for our sins, but we are careless. We make light of sin. We think that by some little work or merit we can dismiss sin. This passage then bears out the fact that all man or soul-denders sin. This attitude springs from a false conception of sin. The conception that sin is a small matter easily taken care of by good works, that we must present ourselves into God with good conscience. that we must feel no sin before we may feel that Christ was given for our sins. This attitude is universal and particularly developed in those who consider themselves better than others.

I love thee with the passion put to use, in my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith, I love thee with a love I seemed to lose with my lost saints. I love thee with the breath, smiles, tears of all my life, and, if God choose, I shall but love the better, after death. To fade away like morning beauty from her mortal day, down by the river of Adana, her soft voices heard, and thus her gentle lamentation falls like morning dew. Oh life of this are spring, why fades the lotus of the water? Why fade these children of the spring, fell is like a watery bow, and like a parting cloud, like a reflection in a glass, like shadows in the water, like dreams of infants, like a smile upon an infant's face, like the dove's voice, like transient day, like music in the air. Ah, and gentle sleep, the sleep of death, and gently hear the voice of him that walk it in the garden in the evening time. The lily of the valley breathing in the humble grass answered the lovely maiden said, I am a watery weed, and I am very small and love to dwell in lowly veils. So weak the gilded butterfly scarce purchase on my head yet I am visited from heaven, and he that smiles on all walks in the valley, and each mourn over me spreads his hand saying, rejoice thou humble grass, thou newborned lily flower.

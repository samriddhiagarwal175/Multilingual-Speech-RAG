But the real significance and comfort of the words for our sins is lost upon them. On the other hand, we are not to regard them as so terrible that we must despair. We want you to help us publish some leading work of Luther's for the General American Market. Will you do it? The condition is that I will be permitted to make Luther talk American. Streamline him, so to speak. You will never get people whether in or outside the Lutheran Church, actually to read Luther unless we make him talk as he would talk today to Americans. Let us begin with that, his commentary on Galatians. The undertaking, which seems so attractive when viewed as a literary task, proved the most difficult one, and at times became oppressive. It was written in Latin. The work had to be condensed. A word should now be said about the origin of Luther's commentary on Galatians. Much later, when a friend of his was preparing an addition of all his Latin works, he remarked to his home circle. If I had my way about it, they would republish only those of my books, which have doctrine, my Galatians for instance.

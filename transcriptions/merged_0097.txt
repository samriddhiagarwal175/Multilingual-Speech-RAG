You will forgive me, dear reader. If I have made you attend the funeral of Sylvia 10 years before her death, believe me, I have no intention of performing a miracle. You may console yourself with the idea that I shall spare you that unpleasant task when poor Sylvia dies. I never had any family. I had a name I believe in my young days, but I have forgotten it since I have been in service. I shall call you a spree. You do me a great honor. Here, go and get me changed for a Louis. I have it, sir. At your service, sir. Madame Quinsong, besides can answer your inquiries, I see a quantity of chairs for hire at the rate of one sue. Men reading the newspaper under the shade of the trees. girls and men breakfasting either alone or in company, waiters who were rapidly going up and down and narrow staircase hidden under the foliage. I sit down at a small table. A waiter comes immediately to inquire my wishes.

Three seconds before the arrival of JB Hobbson's letter, I know more dreamed of chasing the unicorn than of trying for the northwest passage. Even so, I had just returned from an arduous journey, exhausted and badly needing a rest. I wanted nothing more than to see my country again, my friends, my modest quarters by the botanical gardens, my dearly beloved collections. But now nothing could hold me back. Now say was my man's servant. From rubbing shoulders with scientists in our little universe by the botanical gardens, the boy had come to know a thing or two. Classifying was everything to him, so he knew nothing else. Well versed in a theory of classification, he was poorly versed in its practical application, and I doubt that he could tell a sperm whale from a boolean whale, and yet would have fine gallant lead. Not once did he comment on the length or the hardships of the journey. After he objected to buckling up his suitcase for any country, whatever. China or the Congo no matter how far off it was.

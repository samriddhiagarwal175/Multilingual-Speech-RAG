First, as a Paris stock broker, later as a celebrated author and yachtsman, he went on frequent forages to Britain, America, the Mediterranean. Nemo builds a fabulous futuristic submarine, the notalists, then conducts an underwater campaign of vengeance against his imperialist oppressor. In all, the novel had a difficult gestation. Two subtleties occur inside each episode, the textures sparkling with wit, information, and insight. His specifications for an open sea submarine and a self-containing diving suit were decades before their time, yet modern technology bears them out triumphantly. Even the supporting cast is shrewdly drawn. Professor Aranax, the career scientist caught in an ethical conflict, conse the compulsive classifier who supplies humorous tag lines for Verne's Fast Facts. The harpooner Ned Land, a creature of constant appetites, man as heroic animal. But much of the novel's brooding power comes from Captain Nemo. This compulsion leads Nemo into ugly contradictions. He's a fighter for freedom, yet all who board his ship are imprisoned there for good. He works to save lives, both human and animal, yet he himself creates a Holocaust. He detests imperialism, yet he lays personal claim to the South Pole. And in this last action he falls into the classic sin of pride. He's swiftly punished.

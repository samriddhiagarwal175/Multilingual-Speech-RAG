I thought we were stumped again when I first saw that picture, but it's been of some use after all. Do you suppose the miniature was a copy of the same thing? What in the world is it? Query Joyce? May worry, me terribly, ambicides. I'd like to see what this lovely furniture looks like without such quantities of dust all over it. Good, it's scheme, sin. We'll come in here this afternoon with old clothes on and have a regular house cleaning. You can't hurt anything. I'm sure for we won't disturb things at all. This thought, however, did not enter the heads of the enthusiastic pair. Smuggling the house cleaning paraphernalia into the seller window, unabsorbed that afternoon, proved no easy task for Cynthia had added a whisk broom and dust pan to the outfit. The lure proved too much for him and he came sporting after it as friscally as a young kitten, much to Cynthia's delight when she caught sight of him. Oh, let him come along, she urged. I do love to see him about that old house.

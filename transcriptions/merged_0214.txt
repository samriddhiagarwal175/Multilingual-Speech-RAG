They pointedly drew back from John Jago as he approached the empty chair next to me and moved round to the opposite side of the table. A pretty girl, and so far as I could judge by appearances, a good girl too. Describing her generally, I may say that she had a small head, well carried, and well-setter and her shoulders. Bright gray eyes that looked at you honestly and meant what they looked. A trim, slight little figure, too slight for our English notions of beauty. a strong American accent and a rare thing in America, a pleasantly tone voice which made the accent agreeable to English years. Our first impressions of people are, in nine cases out of 10, the right impressions. For once in a way, I proved a true profit.

When I addressed him, he answered constrainedly. A more dreary and more disunited family party I never set a table with.

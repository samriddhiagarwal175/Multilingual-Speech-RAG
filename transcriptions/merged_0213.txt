In five minutes, I was in a new world, and my melancholy room was full of the liveliest French company, the sound of an imperative and uncompromising bell recalled me in due time to the regions of reality. Ambrose met me at the bottom of the stairs and showed me the way to the supper room. She signed to me with a ghostly slim nitty to take the vacant place on the left of her father. The door opened again while I was still studying the two brothers, without I honestly confess, being very favorably impressed by either of them. A new member of the family circle who instantly attracted my attention, entered the room. A little cracked, that in the popular phrase was my impression of the stranger who now made his appearance in the supper room. Mr. Metacroth the elder, having not spoken one word thus far, himself introduced the newcomer to me with a side glance at his sons, which had something like defiance in it. A glance which, as I was sorry to notice, was returned with the defiance on their side by the two young men. Feelable for a hang, this is my overlooker, Mr. Yago, said the old man formally presenting us. He is not well. He has come over the ocean for rest and changes scene.

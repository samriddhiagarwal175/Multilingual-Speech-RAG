Well, I'm convinced that the boarded up house mystery happened not earlier than April 16th, 1861, and probably not much later. No words were spoken, no language was uttered, saved out of wailing and hissing, and that somehow was indistinct, as if it existed in fancy and not in reality. I heard a noise behind. I turned and saw caffer, his black eyes shining, while in his hand he held a gleaming knife. He lifted it above his head as if to strike, but I had the strength of ten men, and I hurled him from me. Onward said a distant voice. No sound broke the stillness of the night. The story of its evil influence came back to me, and in my bewildered condition, I I wondered whether there was not some truth in what had been said. What was that? What then? A human hand, large and shapely, appeared distinctly on the surface of the pond. Nothing more, not even the wrist to which it might be attached. It did not beckon, or indeed move it all. It was as still as the hand of death.

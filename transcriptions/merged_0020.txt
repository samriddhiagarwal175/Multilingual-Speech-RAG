Edison held that the electricity sold must be measured just like gas or water, and he proceeded to develop a meter. There was infinite skepticism around him on the subject, and while other inventors were also giving the subject their thought. The public took it for granted that anything so utterly intangible as electricity that could It not be seen or weighed, and only gave secondary evidence of itself at the exact point of use, could not be brought to accurate registration. Hence the Edison-electrolytic meter is no longer used, despite its excellent qualities. The principle employed in the Edison-electrolytic meter is that which exemplifies the power of electricity to decompose a chemical substance. Associated with the simple form of apparatus, were various ingenious details and refinements to secure regularity of operation, freedom from inaccuracy, and immunity from such tampering as would permit theft of current or damage. The standard Edison meter practice was to remove the cells once a month to the meter room of the Central Station Company for examination. Another set being substituted. In December 1888, Mr. W. J. J. J. R. Redden interesting paper before the American Institute of Electrical Engineers on the six years of practically experience had up to that time with the meter. Then more generally in use than any other. The others, having been in operation too short of time to show definite results, although they also went quickly to a dividend basis. In this connection, it should be mentioned that the association of Edison illuminating companies in the same year adopted resolutions unanimously to the effect that the Edison meter was accurate, and that its use was not expensive for stations above 1000 lights, and that the best financial results were invariably secured in a station selling current by meter. The meter continued in general service during 1899 and probably up to the close of the century.

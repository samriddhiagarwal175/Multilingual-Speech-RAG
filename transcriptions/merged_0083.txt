Whatever Lord Chelford said, Miss Brandon received it very graciously, and even with a momentary smile. But her greeting to Captain Lake was more than usually haughty and frozen, and her features I fancied, particularly proud and pale. At dinner, Lake was easy and amusing. I'm glad you'd like it, says Wilder, chuckling, bendingly on it over his shoulder. I believe I have a little taste that way. Those are all real you know, those jewels. And he placed it in that gentleman's fingers who now took his turn at the lamp and contemplated the little parallelogram with a gleam of slime amusement. I was thinking it's very like the Ace of Hearts, answered the captain softly, smiling on, where upon Lake left quietly, still looking on the Ace of Hearts with his slie eyes, wilder left too. More suddenly and noisily, than the humor of the joke seemed quite to call for, and glanced a grim look from the corners of his eyes on Lake. But the gallant captain did not seem to perceive it, and after a few seconds more he handed it very innocently, back to Mrs. Dorothy, only remarking, do you know? Lake? Oh, I really can't tell, but he'll soon tire of country life.

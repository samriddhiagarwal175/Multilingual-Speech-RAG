slang makes one shudder. Who denies that? Of course it does. When it is a question of probing a wound, a golf, a society, since when has it been considered wrong to go too far, to go to the bottom? We have always thought that it was sometimes a courageous act, and, at least a simple and useful deed were the of the sympathetic attention which duty accepted in fulfilled merits. Why should one not explore everything and study everything? Why should one halt on the way? Nothing is more legubrious than the contemplation thus in its nudity in the broad light of thought of the horrible swarming of slaying. Now, when has horror ever excluded study? Since when has malady banished medicine? Can one imagine a naturalist refusing to study the Viper, the Bat, the Scorpion, the Centipede, the Turanjila, and one who would cast them back into their darkness saying, oh how ugly that is.

But suppose you said, I'm fond of writing. My people always say my letters home are good enough for punch. I've got a little idea for a play about a man and a woman and another woman. But perhaps I better keep the plot a secret for the moment. Anyhow it's a jolly exciting and I can do the dialogue all right. Lin Me or Eir for 10 minutes and you shall learn just what stagecraft is. And I should begin with a short homily onâ€¦ So, a little quick. Ham. GB or not to be. the object of this solar liqueur is plain.

Hama-shal-Soliloquy be avoided without damage to the play.

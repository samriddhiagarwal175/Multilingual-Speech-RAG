Brother Hickey, brother Maccardle, brother Keeoff, their piety would be like their names, like their faces, like their clothes, and it was idle for him to tell himself that their humble and contrite hearts it might be, paid a far Richard tribute of devotion, then his had ever been. A gift tenfold more acceptable than his elaborate adoration. It was idle for him to move himself to be generous towards them, to tell himself that if he ever came to their gates, stripped of his pride, beaten and in beggars' weeds, that they They would be generous towards him, loving him as themselves.

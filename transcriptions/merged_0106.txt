And so life and death have dispersed the circle of violent radicals and dissenters into which 20 years ago the little quiet, Resolute clergyman's daughter was received, and by whom she was truly loved and honored. January and February of 1837 had passed away, and still there was no reply from the Selvi. I'm not depreciating it when I say that in these times it is not rare, but it is not with a view to distinction that you should cultivate this talent. talent if you consult your own happiness. You will say that a woman has no need of such a caution. There can be no peril in it for her. The more she's engaged in her proper duties, the less leisure will she have for it, even as an accomplishment and a recreation. To those duties you have not yet been called and when you are, you will be less eager for celebrity. But do not suppose that I disparage the gift which you possess, nor that I would discourage you from exercising it, I only exhort you so to think of it, and so to use it as to render it conducive to your own permanent good. Farewell, Madame. Though I may be but an ungracious advisor, you will allow me, therefore, to subscribe myself with the best wishes for your happiness here and hereafter, your true friend, Robert Sovi.

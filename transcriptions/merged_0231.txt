At one end stood a great fireplace, in which a blue log was blazing with a blue flame, and over the fire hung four kettles in a row, all bubbling and steaming at a great rate. It takes me several years to make this magic powder, but at this moment I am pleased to say it is nearly done. You see I am making it for my good wife Margot Lott, who wants to use some of it for a purpose of her own. You must know, said Margot Lott, when they were all seated together on the broad window seat. My husband foolishly gave away all the powder of life he first made to old mom be the witch who used to live in the country of the Gillicons to the north of here. The first lot we tested on our glass cat which not only began to live but has lived ever since. I think the next glass cat the magician makes will have neither brains nor heart, for then it will not object to catching mice and may prove of some use to us. I'm afraid I don't know much about the land of us. You see, I've lived all my life without Nunkie, the silent one, and there was no one to tell me anything. That is one reason you are Ojo the unlucky, said the woman in sympathetic tone. I think I must show you my patchwork girl, said Margot Lot, laughing at the boys' astonishment. For she is rather difficult to explain. But first I will tell you that for many years I have longed for his servant to help me with the housework and to cook the meals and wash the dishes.

said Captain Danny Thorne, sitting himself where he could see along the short passage to the open dairy door. No sir, he isn't. He's gone to Rossiter to see Mr. West, the factor about the wool. But there's father in Barnes, sir, if he'd be of any use. No, thank you. I'll just look at the welbs and leave a message about them with your shepherd. I must come another day and see your husband. I want to have a consultation with him about horses. for if is anywhere on the farm we can send for him in a minute. Oh, sir. Sid Mrs. Poise, rather alarmed. You wouldn't like it at all, but you know more about that than I do, sir. I think I should be doing you a service to turn you out of such a place. I know his farm is in better order than any other within ten miles of us. And as for the kitchen he added smiling. I don't believe there's one in the kingdom to beat it.

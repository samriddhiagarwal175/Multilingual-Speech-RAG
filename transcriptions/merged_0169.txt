He passes abruptly from persons to ideas and numbers, and from ideas and numbers to persons, from the heavens to man, from astronomy to physiology. He confuses, a rather does not distinguish subject and object, first and final causes, and is dreaming of geometrical figures lost in a flux of sense. The influence which the Timeyus has exercised upon posterity is due partly to a misunderstanding. In the supposed depths of this dialogue, the neoplatinists found hidden meanings in connections with the Jewish and Christian scriptures, and out of them, they elicited doctrines quite at variance with the spirit of Plato. They were absorbed in his theology and were under the dominion of his name, while that which was truly great and truly characteristic in him, his effort to realize and connect abstractions was not understood by them at all. There is no danger of the modern commentators on the TMS, following in Jdb's surgeries of the Neoplatanists. In the present day, we are well aware that an ancient philosopher is to be interpreted from himself and by the contemporary history of thought. the fancies of the neoplatanists are only interesting to us because they exited a phase of the human mind which prevailed widely in the first centuries of the Christian era, and is not wholly extinct in our own day. But they have nothing to do with the interpretation of Plato, and in spirit they are opposed to him. We do not know how Plato would have arranged his own dialogues, or whether the thought of arranging any of them besides the two trilogies which he has expressly connected was ever present to his mind. The dialogue is primarily concerned with the animal creation, including under this term the heavenly bodies and with man only as one among the animals.

It was silent and gloomy, being tenented solely by the captive and lighted by the dying embers of a fire which had been used for the purpose of cookery. Onkus occupied a distant corner in a reclining attitude, being rigidly bound both hands and feet by strong and painful wits. The scout who had left David at the door to ascertainly were not observed, thought it prudent to preserve his disguise until assured of their privacy. What shall we do with the mingo's at the door? They count six, and this singer is as good as nothing. The Delaware's are children of the tortoise, and they outstrip the deer. Onkes, who had already approached the door and readiness to lead the way, now recoiled, and placed himself once more in the bottom of the lodge. But Haka, who was too much occupied with his own thoughts to note the movement, continued speaking more to himself than to his companion. So onkes, you'd better take the lead, while I will put on the skin again and trust to cunning for want of speed. Well, what can't be done by main courage and war must be done by circumvention. As soon as these dispositions were made, the scout turned to David and gave him his parting instructions.

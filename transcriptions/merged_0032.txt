By the by, I've never seen your dairy. I must see your dairy, Mrs. Poiser. This, Mrs. Poiser, said blushing and believing that the captain was really interested in her milk pans and would adjust his opinion of her to the appearance of her dairy. Oh, I've no doubt, it's in capital order. Out in the woods stood a nice little fir tree. The plain sea had was a very good one. The sun shone on him. As to fresh air, there was enough of that, and round him grew many large-sized comrades, pines, as well as furs. He did not think of the warm sun and of the fresh air. He did not care for the little cottage children that ran about and prattled when they were in the woods looking for wild strawberries. But this was what the tree could not bear to hear. Winter. When the snow lay glittering on the ground, a hair would often come leaping along, and jump right over the little tree. Oh, that made him so angry, to grow and grow, to get older and be tall. Thought the tree. That, after all, is the most delightful thing in the world.

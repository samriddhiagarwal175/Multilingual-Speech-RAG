Brought as the prairies and free and thought as the winds that swept them, he is idiocyndcratically opposed to loose and wasteful methods, to plans of empire that neglect the poor at the gate. Everything he has done has been aimed at the conservation of energy, the contraction of space, the intensification of culture. For some years, it was not found feasible to operate motors on alternating current circuits, And that reason was often urged against it seriously. It could not be used for electromplating or deposition. Nor could it charge storage batteries. All of which are easily within the ability of the direct current. But when it came to be a question of lighting a scattered suburb, a group of dwellings on the outskirts, a remote country residence, or a farmhouse, the alternating current in all Elements, Saviour's danger, was Andy's ideal. Edison was intolerant of sham and shoddy, and nothing would satisfy him that could not stand cross-examination by microscope, test tube, and galvanometer. Unless he could secure an engine of smoother running, and more exactly governed and regulated than those available for his dynamo and lamp. Edison realized that he would find it almost impossible to give a steady light. Mr. Edison was a leader far ahead of the time. He obtained the desired speed and load with a friction break, also regulator of speed, but waited for an indicator to verify it. Then again there was no known way to lubricate an engine for continuous running. And Mr. Edison informed me that, as a marine engine started before the ship left New York and continued running until it reached its home port, so an engine for his purposes must produce light at all times.

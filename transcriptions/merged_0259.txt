They informed the English Parliament of this unexpected incident and assured them that they had entered into no private treaty with the King. Or half-he, given us any gift. And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah and said, we have ten parts in the King. And we have also more right in David than ye. By then did ye despise us, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king. Another preacher, after reproaching him to his face with his misgovernment, ordered this Psalm to be sung. The king stood up and called for that Psalm, which begins with these words. The mercy lord on me I pray, for men would me devour. The good nature of audience in pity to fall and majesty, showed for once greater deference to the king than to the minister, and sung the Psalm which the former had called for. The Parliament and the Scots laid their proposals before the king. Before the settlement of terms, the administration must be possessed entirely by the the parliaments of both kingdoms, and how incompatible that scheme with the liberty of the King is easily imagined. The English, it is evident, had they not been previously assured of receiving the King, would never have parted with so considerable of some, and while they weakened themselves, by the same measure, have strengthened a people with whom they most afterwards have so material and interest to discuss.

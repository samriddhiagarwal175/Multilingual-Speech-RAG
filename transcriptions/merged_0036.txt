That's the way of the world! Thought the Fertory, and believed it all, because the man who told the story was so good looking. Well, well, I won't tremble tomorrow, thought the Fertory, and the whole night, the tree stood still, and in deep thought. In the morning the servant and the housemate came in, but they dragged him out of the room and up the stairs into the loft. And here, in a dark corner where no daylight could enter, they left him.

And when it last somebody did come it was only to put some great trunks in a corner out of the way. is now winter out of doors. Thought the tree.

Sir, March 16th. I have not ventured to hope for such a reply, so consider it in its tone, so noble in its spirit. I know the first letter I wrote to you was all senseless trash from beginning to end, but I am not altogether the idle dreaming being it would seem to denote. I thought at there for my duty when I left school to become a governess. In the evenings I confess I do think, but I never trouble anyone else with my thoughts. I carefully avoid any appearance of preoccupation and eccentricity, which might lead those I live amongst to suspect the nature of my pursuits. I don't always succeed. For sometimes when I'm teaching or sewing, I would rather be reading a writing, but I try to deny myself and my father's app probation, amply rewarded me for the provision. Again, I thank you. This incident I suppose will be renewed no more. If I live to be an old woman, I shall remember it 30 years hence as a bright dream. PS, price, excuse me for writing to you a second time. I could not help writing, partly to tell you how thankful I am for your kindness, and partly to let you know that your advice shall not be wasted, however sorefully and reluctantly it may be at first followed. C.B. I cannot deny myself the gratification of inserting so these reply.

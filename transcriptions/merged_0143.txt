The only duplicate which existed so far as I knew was that which belonged to my servant, Bannister, a man who has looked after my room for 10 years and whose honesty is absolutely above suspicion. The moment I looked at my table I was aware that someone had rummaged among my papers. The proof was in three long slips. I had left them all together. The alternative was that someone passing had observed the key in the door, had known that I was out and had entered to look at the papers. I gave him a little brandy and left him collapsed and a chair while I made a most careful examination of the room. A broken tip of lead was lying there also. Not only this, but on the table I found a small ball of black dough or clay with specks of something which looks like sawdust in it. Above all things I desire to settle the matter quietly and discreetly. To the best of my belief, they were rolled up. Did anyone know that these proofs would be there? No one saved the printer..

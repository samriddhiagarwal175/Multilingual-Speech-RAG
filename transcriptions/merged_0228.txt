From the manner in which he expressed himself with regard to Robert Holland, no man in the whole range of his recollections will be longer remembered than he. His enthrallment while under Holland will hardly ever be forgotten. Of this party, Edward, a boy of 17, called forth much sympathy, he too was claimed by Holland, John Wesley, Combash, Jacob Taylor, and Thomas Edward Skinner. A few years back, one of their slaves, a coachman, was kept on the coach box one called night when they were out at a ball until he became almost frozen to death. In fact, he did die in the infirmary from the effects of the frost about one week afterwards. The doctor who attended the injured creature in this case was simply told that she slipped and fell down the stairs as she was coming down. Another case said John Wesley. was a little girl, half grown, who was washing windows upstairs one day, and unlocally fell asleep in the window, and in this position was found by her mistress. In a rage, the mistress hid her a heavy slap, knocked her out of the window, and she fell to the pavement, and died in a few hours from the effects thereof. As usual, nothing was done in the way of punishment. I never knew of, but one man who could ever pleased him. He worked me very hard. He wanted to be beating me all the time. She was a large, homely woman. They were common white people. There was no reputation in the community.

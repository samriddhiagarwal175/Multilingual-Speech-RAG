Familiarity is a feeling capable of degrees. In an image of a well-known face, for example, some parts may feel more familiar than others. When this happens, we have more belief in the accuracy of the familiar parts than in that of the unfamiliar parts. I come now to the other characteristic, which memory images must have in order to account for our knowledge of the past. They must have some characteristic, which makes us regard them as referring to more or less remote portions of the past. In actual fact, there are doubtless various factors that concur in giving us the feeling of greater or less remoteness and some remembered event. There may be a specific feeling which could be called the feeling of pastness, especially where immediate memory is concerned. There is, of course, a difference between knowing the temporal relation of a remembered event to the present and knowing the time order of two remembered events. It would seem that only rather recent events can be placed at all accurately by means of feelings giving their temporal relation to the present. But it is clear that such feelings must play an essential part in the process of dating remembered events. If we had retained the subject or act in knowledge, the whole problem of memory would have been comparatively simple. Remembering has to be a present occurrence in some way resembling or related to what is remembered.

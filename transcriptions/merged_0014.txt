The Golden Flies. It's the Silver Flies. He harkened. Sometimes you're damaged, please. Won't you? Now for a one little half hour, She had been a woman talking to a boy. No, not even that. She had been talking. Just talking. There were no persons in the conversation. Just things. One thing. Cotton. He knew the Silver Flies. His and Zora's must be ruined. He ruined. It was the first great sorrow of his life. It was not so much the loss of the cotton itself, but the fantasy, the hopes, the dreams built around it. Ah, the swamp, the cruel swamp. The revelation of his love lighted and brightened slowly to let flame like a sunrise over him and left him in burning wonder. He painted to know if she too knew, or knew, and cared not, or cared, and knew not. She was so strange in human accreture. world was water-bailed in myths.

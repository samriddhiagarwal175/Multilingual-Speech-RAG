Do you suppose that God, for the sake of a few Lutheran heretics, would disown his entire church? Against these boasting false apostles, Paul boldly defends his apostolic authority in ministry. As the ambassador of a government is honored for his office, and not for his private person, so the minister of Christ should exalt his office, in order to gain authority among men. Paul takes pride in his ministry, not to his own phrase, but to the praise of God, Paul and Apostle. Possible, not of men, etc. Either he calls ministers through the agency of men, or he calls them directly as he called the prophets in apostles. Paul declares that the false apostles were called or sent neither by men nor by men. The most they could claim is that they were sent by others. He mentions the apostles first because they were appointed directly by God. The call is not to be taken lightly.

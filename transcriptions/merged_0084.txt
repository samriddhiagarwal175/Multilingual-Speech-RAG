He's not a man for country quarters. I had a horror dream about him last night. That? Oh, I know. That's Lauren Brandon. All the time he was talking to me, his angry little eyes were following leak. It was not very much past 11 that morning when the pony carriage from Brandon drew up before the little garden wicked of Redmond's farm. Well, she was better, though she had had a bad night. So there came a step and a little rustling of feminine draperies, the small door opened and Rachel entered with her hand extended and a pale smile of welcome. Women can hide their pain better than we men and bear it better too, except when shame drops fire into the dreadful chalice. But poor Rachel leak had more than that stoical hypocrisy which enables the tortured spirits of her sex to lift a pale face through the flames and smile. This transit spring and lighting up are beautiful, a glamour beguiling our senses.

One of the sailors led me to the afterdeck where I stood in the presence of a smart-looking officer who extended his hand to me. In person, welcome aboard Professor, your cabin is waiting for you. I was well satisfied with my cabin, which was located in the stern and opened into the officer's mess. We'll be quite comfortable here, I told Comstay. And so if I had been delayed by a quarter of an hour or even less, the frigate would have gone without me, and I would have messed out on this unearthly, extraordinary and inconceivable expedition whose true story might well meet with some skepticism. The wars of Brooklyn and every part of New York bordering the East River were crowded with curiosity seekers. Departing from 500,000 throats, three cheers burst forth in succession. Thousands of hanker chips were waving above these tightly packed masses, hailing the Abraham Lincoln until it reached the waters of the Hudson River at the tip of the long peninsula that forms New York City. It's almost beyond conjecture. This reality begins to explain the dark power and other worldly fascination of thousand leagues under the stage.

For a person to possess knowledge is not enough. It spoils one's best work. When I was a young man I thought Paul was making too much of his call. I did not then realize the importance of the ministry. I knew nothing of the doctrine of faith because we were taught sofistry instead of certainty, and nobody understood spiritual boasting. This is no sinful pride. It is holy pride. And God the Father who raised him from the dead. The class seemed super-verbalist on first sight. These pervertors of the righteousness of Christ resist the Father and the Son and the works of them both. In this whole epistle, Paul treats the resurrection of Christ.

Then, lure Tupene, well what about auction? The crowd drifts off leaving the hero and hero in alone in the middle of the stage, and then you can begin. Then is the time to introduce a meal on the stage. A stage meal is popular because it proves to the audience that the actors, even one called Charles Holtrie or Owen Nares, are real people just like you and me.

Whether or not this principle is liable to exceptions, everyone would agree that it has a broad measure of truth, though the word exactly might seem an overstatement, and it might seem more correct to say that I'd just approximately represent impressions. And what sort of evidence is logically possible? There is no logical impossibility in the hypothesis that the world's springing to being five minutes ago, exactly as it then was, with the population that remembered a wholly unreal past. All that I'm doing is to use its logical tonability as a help in the analysis of what occurs when we remember. The behaviorist who attempts to make psychology a record of behavior has to trust his memory and making the record. Habit is a concept involving the occurrence of similar events at different times. If the behaviorist feels confident that there is such a phenomenon as habit, that can only be because he trusts his memory when it assures him that there have been other times. But I do not think such an inference is warranted. Our confidence or lack of confidence in the accuracy of a memory image must, in fundamental cases, be based upon a characteristic of the image itself, since we cannot evoke the past bodily and compare it with the present image. We sometimes have images that are binomines peculiarly vague, which yet we do not trust. For example, under the influence of fatigue, we may see a Franz face vividly and clearly, but horribly distorted. Some images, like some sensations, feel very familiar while others feel strange.
